## Project Summary
In the automotive manufacturing industry, unexpected equipment failures can cause costly downtime, missed delivery targets, and reduced product quality. This project aims to shift from reactive to predictive maintenance by using IoT sensor data — including temperature, vibration, voltage, and pressure — to assess machine health in real time. We developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that identifies at-risk equipment, forecasts potential failures, and quantifies maintenance cost savings. This enables decision-makers to schedule interventions proactively, reduce operational disruptions, and improve production efficiency.
