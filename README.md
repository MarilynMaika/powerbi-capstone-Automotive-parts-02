## Project Summary
In the automotive manufacturing industry, unexpected equipment failures can cause costly downtime, missed delivery targets, and reduced product quality. This project aims to shift from reactive to predictive maintenance by using IoT sensor data ‚Äî including temperature, vibration, voltage, and pressure ‚Äî to assess machine health in real time. We developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that identifies at-risk equipment, forecasts potential failures, and quantifies maintenance cost savings. This enables decision-makers to schedule interventions proactively, reduce operational disruptions, and improve production efficiency.


‚úÖ **Preventive Cost**

Preventive costs refer to the expenses incurred to prevent equipment failure or reduce the risk of breakdown. These are planned, scheduled maintenance activities performed regularly, even if the equipment appears to be working well.

Examples:
Routine inspections, Lubrication and cleaning, Replacing parts before failure, Calibration of machinery

Goal: To avoid breakdowns, extend equipment life, and reduce long-term costs.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Reactive Cost**

Reactive costs are the expenses incurred when equipment fails unexpectedly, and action is taken after the failure. This is also called run-to-failure or corrective maintenance.

Examples: Emergency repair services, Replacement of damaged components, Downtime and lost productivity, Extra labor or overtime


Goal: To restore function, but often at higher costs due to urgency and damage.

## üìä Dashboard: Equipments Overview

This dashboard provides a high-level summary of equipment performance, focusing on failure rates, costs, and operating conditions:

üîπ Key Insights:
Cost Saving Percent: The equipment has achieved a 0.64% cost saving through preventive maintenance or other optimizations.

Number of Equipment: The system tracks 20 unique equipment units.

Predicted Failures: A total of 525 failures are predicted, emphasizing the need for robust preventive strategies.

Reactive to Preventive Cost Ratio: The ratio stands at 4.59, meaning reactive maintenance is 4.59 times more costly than preventive maintenance, highlighting inefficiency in reactive strategies.

üìà Trends and Distributions:
Equipment Failure Rate (over time): Failure rates peaked around May‚ÄìJuly 2024, suggesting operational or environmental stress during that period.

Temperature Category Distribution:

Most sensor readings are from Medium (687) temperature conditions.

High temperatures (200) correlate with increased failure risk.

Low temperatures (113) are least common.

Equipment Condition:

74.7% of the records indicate critical equipment status, underscoring high operational risk.

Cost by Manufacturer:

Bosch, Honeywell, and GE have significantly high cost avoided figures, but preventive costs remain low across all manufacturers.

This suggests high savings potential if preventive actions are scaled.
