**Course:** DSA 3050A | Group 3
 

---

## Problem Statement
In the automotive parts manufacturing sector, equipment failures lead to unplanned downtime and high reactive maintenance costs. Traditional maintenance strategies are inefficient, costly, and do not provide insight into failure trends or performance optimization.

---

## Objective
Leverage IoT sensor data to:

- Predict potential equipment failures
- Identify cost savings from preventive maintenance
- Reduce long-term maintenance expenses
- Improve operational efficiency

---

## Key KPIs Tracked
- Reactive vs Preventive Maintenance Costs
- ROI from cost avoided
- Failure Rate per Equipment Type
- Cost Ratio (Reactive/Preventive)
- Predicted Failures in Non-Critical Equipment
- Sensor Health Scores
- Temperature Category insights

---

## Value Proposition
Our predictive maintenance system enables:

- Data-driven decision making for maintenance
- Equipment risk profiling based on historical failure data
- Monthly ROI tracking to show cost-benefit impact
- Efficient scheduling of maintenance to reduce breakdowns

---

## Business Impact
By shifting maintenance from reactive to preventive and leveraging predictive analytics, we reduce costs and enhance equipment availability. ROI insights show preventive actions saving up to **150%** in cost per month in certain periods.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI
- Excel (ROI Calculations)
- DAX for analytical modeling
- Star schema-based relational model
